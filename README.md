Here are a few examples of how to use `paramspider`:

  ```

  ```

    ```sh 
    paramspider -d example.com -s
    ```

    paramspider -d example.com --proxy '127.0.0.1:7890'

### What I changed
- Fixed typos: **"achives" → "archives"**, **"termial" → "terminal"**, **"modifiy" → "modify"** (in your request), etc.
- Improved wording for clarity and consistency.
- Normalized examples (used `example.com` consistently).
- Added a short License section and a small note about editable install.

If you want, I can:
- produce a `README.md` file and attach it, or
- show a concise changelog/diff between the original and the fixed file, or
- add a figlet/lolcat ASCII banner and a few alternate banner styles for your CLI header. Which of those should I do next?
